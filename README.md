In the Probability & Statistics course project titled "Analysis of the Impact of Monthly Student Allowances on Health," this study investigates the relationship between students' monthly allowances and their physical and mental health. Data was collected through online surveys targeting university students, examining variables such as allowance amount, spending habits, and health status. Statistical methods like linear regression and variance analysis were applied to analyze how financial resources correlate with students' well-being. The findings aim to offer insights for universities to develop effective health and financial support programs.
